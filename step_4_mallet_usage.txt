For this project, mallet 2.0.7 was run on a Microsoft Windows 7 machine.

Mallet was located at:
C:\mallet\

The downloaded and pre-processed case laws are located at:
C:\mallet\step4\caselaws\

The created stop words file was located at:
C:\mallet\step4\stopwords.txt


The three used commend line rguments (order must be the same):
cd C:\mallet

bin\mallet import-dir --input step4\caselaws --output step4\caselaw.mallet --keep-sequence --stoplist-file step4\stopwords.txt --token-regex "[\p{L}\p{M}]+"
bin\mallet train-topics --input step4\caselaw.mallet

--num-topics 150 --xml-topic-phrase-report step4\topics.xml --output-doc-topics step4\composition.txt 



Explanation:
--token-regex "[\p{L}\p{M}]+" provides  support  for  unicode letters and marks, without it, only normal letters (a to z) can be used.
On a linux machine ’[\p{L}\p{M}]+’ should be used.

--xml-phrase-report provides support for word phrases, without it, word order is ignored.
